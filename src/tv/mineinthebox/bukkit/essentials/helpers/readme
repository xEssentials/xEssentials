Helper objects.

this package is used for Helper objects only, this package is ment to add more compatability for newer and or older versions of bukkit aslong we could maintain it.

this package will contain various methods or hacky solutions to work around the issues as we've found.
some of these helper objects use reflection to bypass the compilation and instead inject new code in runtime-
in order the plugin still works on older versions while it is compiled with the latest version of bukkit.
